## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota, working with Professor [Zhenong Jin](https://umn-digitalag.com/people/) in the [Digital Agriculture Group](https://umn-digitalag.com/). My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning approaches to investigate sustainable agricultural production under climate change. I received my Ph.D. in Biosystems Engineering from Zhejiang University, where I was advised by Professors [K.C. Ting](https://abe.illinois.edu/directory/kcting), [Yibin Ying](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0089059), and [Tao Lin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lintaolab).

## Research Interests

- **Biogeochemical Processes in Agroecosystems:** Water-carbon-nitrogen nexus, hydrologic modeling.
- **Satellite-based Cropland Monitoring:** Land use/cover mapping, crop yield prediction.
- **Postharvest Technologies for Agroproducts:** Quality control, spectral/image processing.
