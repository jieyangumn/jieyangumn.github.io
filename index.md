## About Me
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working with Professors [Kaiyu Guan](http://faculty.nres.illinois.edu/~kaiyuguan/) and [Bin Peng](https://pengbinpeluo.github.io/). My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning approaches to investigate sustainable agricultural production under climate change.<br>I received my Ph.D. in Biosystems Engineering from Zhejiang University, where I was advised by Professors [K.C. Ting](https://abe.illinois.edu/directory/kcting), [Yibin Ying](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0089059), and [Tao Lin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lintaolab). Following that, I completed my first postdoctoral training at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities with Professor [Zhenong Jin](https://umn-digitalag.com/).


## Research Interests
- **Biogeochemical Processes in Agroecosystems:** Water-carbon-nitrogen nexus, agricultural hydrology.
- **Satellite-based Cropland Monitoring:** Land use/cover mapping, crop yield prediction.
- **Postharvest Technologies for Agroproducts:** Food quality control, spectral/image processing.
